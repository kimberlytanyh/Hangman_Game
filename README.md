## Hangman Game

In this repository, you will find an interactive text-based Hangman Game created in a Jupyter Notebook with specific functionality. The functions in the game are written as comments in the notebook as per assignment requirements.

A breakdown of the game components and download-free access to the game via Google Colab can be found on [my Wix website portfolio](https://kimberlytanyh.wixsite.com/portfolio).
