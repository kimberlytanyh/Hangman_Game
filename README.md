## Hangman_Game

In this repository, you will find an interactive text-based Hangman Game created in a Jupyter Notebook with specific functionality. The functions in the game are written as comments in the notebook as per assignment requirements.

A breakdown of the game and download-free access to the game on Google Colab can be found on my Wix website portfolio: [Link to Wix](https://kimberlytanyh.wixsite.com/portfolio)
